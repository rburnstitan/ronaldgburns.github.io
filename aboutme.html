  Hey there! I'm Ron, but you can just call me ((PacMAn))—that's what all my friends do! English is still a bit new to me.
I greeted the world on December 4, 1989, with the rising sun. Currently, you'll find me at Front Range Community College, working towards a BAS in Geospatial Sciences. I'm also armed with a Culinary Certificate from Emily Griffith Technical College and an Associates of Arts in Geography from Community College of Aurora.
One thing you should know about me—I have a deep passion for travel! It's where I truly come alive. Oh, and I share this adventure with my identical twin brother, Michael. We're a dynamic duo, you could say.
At home, you'll find me with two lively dogs, Donte and Bella. They keep things interesting, to say the least.
When I'm not traversing the globe or spending time with my twin and fur babies, I have a few hobbies I'm pretty serious about. Running, scuba diving, and exploring maps are some of my go-to activities. And of course, there's my love affair with food. Eating it, cooking it, and giving it a good critique afterward—those are the moments I live for. Hiking is another favorite of mine. There's nothing like the feeling of conquering a new trail.
Switching gears a bit, let's talk entertainment. I've got a few favorite shows that always hit the spot: "So Help Me Todd," "Survivor," "RuPaul's Drag Race," "The Amazing Race," "Angry Beavers," "Aaahh!!! Real Monsters," "Doug," and "Rollie Pollie Ollie." They're my go-tos for a good time.
And when it comes to music, my taste spans quite a range. I'm all about Rise Against, Taking Back Sunday, Tiesto, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Pentatonix, Tones & I, and Sam Smith. They each have a special place in my heart.
Now, let's talk grub. There are a few spots that really hit the mark for me. Shish Kabob Grill, Sandra's El Pardon, and El Loca Antigua are my top picks. Trust me, if you ever need a dining recommendation, I'm your guy.
